Starting it off with a project I just completed 

10/11- Password Generator/Manager
  Description: The password manager application offers users a secure and user-friendly solution for generating, storing, and retrieving passwords. It allows users to create strong, random passwords of custom lengths, ensuring data security through encryption and base64 encoding. The app allows easy password storage and retrieval for various accounts, and it maintains data persistence even after closing the application. With the ability to copy passwords to the clipboard, it makes the process a lot easier.
